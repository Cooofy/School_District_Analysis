# School District Analysis

### Overview of Project

By removing Thomas High School's grade 9 reading and math scores to see if it will affect the overall data outcome. And at the same time will the numbers affect Thomas High School itself.

### Results

##### How is the district summary affected?
While removing those scores, you may not see a huge difference in the numbers but there is a change that affects the distict summary as seen below in the two picures.

##### How is the school summary affected?
The school summary is not changed as the only thing we have changed is data for Thomas High school as shown in the pictures below.

##### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The perforamnces are pretty much the same even with removing Thomas High School's grade 9 math and reading scores as seen in the pictures below.

##### Top School's

##### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade

No changes to the data fram except that for Tomas High Schools 9th grade scores are removed.

- Scores by school spending

No changes to the data frame.

- Scores by school size

No changes to the data frame.

- Scores by school type

Very minor changes, however when you format the data frame they both beome identical as shown in the pictures below.

### Summary
One of the major changes we have done was we subtracted 461 students from the original dataset which were all the 9th graders in Tomas High School. With the subtraction of those students, we see right away that the overall passing percentage has dropped almost 7.00%. However even with 461 students not being counted for the new dataset the average math and reading scores remain almost the same along with average passing for both categories. Also, when you are looking the spending summary based on the ranges the $630-$644 bracket barely changes with the subtraction of the 9th graders.
